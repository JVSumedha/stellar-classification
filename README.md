# Stellar Classification Project: Utilizes machine learning to predict star classes from astronomical data.

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on stellar classification. 
The goal is to predict star classes based on astronomical data features. 
The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees,
1  Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. 
2  Key techniques employed include data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling), feature engineering specifically, Principal Component Analysis, and comprehensive model training and evaluation. 
The repository includes code for data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, and performance analysis, with metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices to assess model effectiveness.
